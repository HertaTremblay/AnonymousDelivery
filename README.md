# Anonymous Delivery Network

A privacy-preserving delivery platform built on blockchain technology that ensures complete anonymity for both senders and recipients while maintaining delivery integrity.

## üîê Core Concepts

### FHE (Fully Homomorphic Encryption) Smart Contracts
Our platform leverages Fully Homomorphic Encryption within smart contracts to enable computations on encrypted delivery data without revealing sensitive information. This revolutionary approach allows:

- **Encrypted Address Processing**: Delivery addresses remain encrypted throughout the entire process
- **Private Route Optimization**: Delivery routes are calculated on encrypted location data
- **Confidential Payment Processing**: Transaction amounts and payment details stay private
- **Anonymous Identity Verification**: Participant verification without identity disclosure

### Anonymous Delivery Network
The anonymous delivery network creates a decentralized ecosystem where privacy is paramount:

- **Privacy-Preserving Delivery Information**: All delivery details including addresses, recipient names, and package contents are encrypted and protected
- **Zero-Knowledge Delivery Matching**: Couriers can accept deliveries without seeing sensitive delivery information
- **Encrypted Communication Channels**: All communications between parties use end-to-end encryption
- **Anonymous Reputation System**: Build trust without compromising identity through cryptographic reputation scores

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Complete Anonymity**: Both senders and recipients maintain full privacy
- **Secure Payments**: Cryptocurrency payments with privacy protection
- **Decentralized Matching**: Smart contract-based delivery assignment
- **Reputation System**: Trustless rating system for service quality
- **Real-time Tracking**: Monitor deliveries while preserving privacy
- **Global Accessibility**: Borderless delivery network

## üì± Platform Overview

The Anonymous Delivery Network consists of three main user roles:

### üì¶ Senders
- Create delivery requests with encrypted destination information
- Set delivery preferences and payment terms
- Track delivery progress anonymously
- Rate delivery services without revealing identity

### üöö Couriers
- Browse available delivery opportunities
- Accept deliveries based on encrypted location preferences
- Receive payments automatically upon completion
- Build anonymous reputation scores

### üìã Recipients
- Receive packages without exposing personal information
- Confirm delivery completion securely
- Participate in quality rating system

## üèóÔ∏è Smart Contract Architecture

### Contract Address
**Sepolia Testnet**: `0x6A959E813D95B911b75D9A307532eF3316e87304`

The smart contract system includes:

- **DeliveryManager**: Core contract handling delivery lifecycle
- **PrivacyLayer**: FHE implementation for encrypted data processing
- **PaymentProcessor**: Secure, anonymous payment handling
- **ReputationTracker**: Anonymous rating and reputation management

## üì∏ Platform Demonstrations

### Create Delivery Request Transaction
Our platform demonstrates seamless delivery request creation with complete privacy protection. Users can submit delivery requests with encrypted destination information, ensuring that sensitive location data never appears in plaintext on the blockchain.

### Accept Delivery Transaction
The delivery acceptance process showcases how couriers can commit to deliveries based on encrypted routing preferences without accessing private delivery information, maintaining the anonymity of all parties involved.
